# TXSScan: annotation of bacterial protein secretion systems

This set of MacSyFinder's models are dedicated to the genomic detection of bacterial secretion systems, and of evolutionarily related appendages. 
The systems that can be detected are the following: 

- T1SS: the type I secretion system 
- T2SS: the type II secretion system  
- T3SS: the type III secretion system  
- T4P, Tad: the type IV pilus and the tight-adherence pilus (Tad) respectively, both related to the T2SS. See also the MacSyData repository "TFF-SF" for more precise detection of members from the type IV filament super-family. 
- pT4SSt, pT4SSi: two different types of type IV secretion systems involved in protein secretion (based on Mating Pair Formation type t and i respectively).
- T5aSS, T5bSS, T5cSS: three different types of type V secretion system, namely the autotransporter (T5aSS), the two-partner secretion system (T5bSS) and the trimeric secretion system (T5cSS). 
- T6SSi, T6SSii, T6SSiii: three variants of the type VI secretion system, namely the broadly distributed T6SSi, the one discovered in Francisella (T6SSii) and the one discovered in Bacteroidetes (T6SSiii).  
- Flagellum: the bacterial flagellum, related to the T3SS. Note: components detected with this model are sufficient to distinguish between the flagellum and the related T3SS, but do not fully annotate the flagellar components. 
- Tad: 
- T9SS: the type IX secretion system


This set of models corresponds to those published in 2016 in Scientific Reports (see below for full reference), updated to the format to enable systems search with **MacSyFinder version 2**. 


## Installation and Usage with MacSyFinder

First, the `macsyfinder` program should be [installed](http://macsyfinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This will also install the `macsydata` tool that enables to easily install this package of MacSyFinder models from this repository. 


The basic commands to run are then:

    macsydata install TXSScan


to install the TXSScan package. 

    macsyfinder --db-type ordered_replicon \
		--sequence-db myproteins.fasta \
		--models TXSScan system 		


to run the search on your favorite organism's genom, where `system` is one or multiple systems listed above, or `all` to search for all the above listed systems
(see [MacSyFinder's documentation](http://macsyfinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)). 


It has to be noted that to ensure the highest annotation specificity, it is recommended to search for **all** systems in the package at once.
